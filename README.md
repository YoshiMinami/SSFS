This app is seaching the chea[est petro station near current position.

Fuel prices go up every day and most motorists are wondering which petrol station has the cheapest fuel 
and is near me. Information on petrol station prices and which is the nearest to them will save energy 
and cost for the customer. 
According to our research on how many service stations are near you? 34% of Kiwis surveyed by Canstar Blue
said they would drive across town for cheap fuel. In places like Waikato and the Bay of Plenty, the percentage 
was even higher, up to 44%. People estimated that they often travelled more than 10km to find cheap fuel. 
In Auckland, it was more than 13km!  Radio NZ reported in January 2015 that Z and BP had lowered their petrol 
prices to match other cheaper stations. So theoretically you can go wherever you want now, without worrying 
about driving far to find cheap fuel. We take a look at how many stations there are in New Zealand and how to 
find the one closest to you.
Now a days each and every single person owns a smart phone or a tablet outside home and during travel. 
Therefore, creating a mobile application that will have features to show a customer the cheapest fuel station 
is our main idea.  
During our research, we came across mobile applications with a similar idea that already exist in the New Zealand
market, however we found out that in this particular application (NZ Fuel Watch) does not update the fuel prices
regularly. Therefore, we decided to go forward with our idea for our mobile application called “Smart Searching 
Fuel Station” or “SSFS” and added more features to it.  

This application has many functions of service. This report shows screenshot which make clear the contents of 
application using the graphical image. Our produce provides the following functions. 
•	Authentication function
•	Searching the cheapest station
•	Fuel price reporting function
•	Reward function
•	My car information function
•	My favourite station function
All functions are not contained in this report. The detail of all function should be explained in User manual. 
Also, the coding of application are not included in this report.
